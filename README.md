# ISS-Locator
Simple program to find the latitude, longitude, number of astronauts on the ISS, and the names of those astronauts

*****WORK IN PROGRESS*****

Idea from https://codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/python/iss/

# Modules required:

-import json

-import urllib.request

-links: https://codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/python/iss/ (already in code), http://api.open-notify.org/iss-now.json (already in code)

# Adding:
-Map the ISS on a world map

-Map the ISS on a world map with trajectory over the next 24 hours

-Tell when the station will be over certain location (using geopy to get city name and translate to lat long)
